# Fatigue and Sleep Disturbance are Prevalent Symptoms

- Digital health technologies, such as activity trackers, may provide a novel way to measure impacts of fatigue and sleep disturbances in patients with chronic immune diseases.

<img src="include/fatigue_sleep_ideafast.png">

???

- Prevalence in many chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases is above 50%
  for fatigue and sleep disturbance
- New tools are needed to understand the real impact of these symptoms on
  patient's daily lives.
- This schematic is taken from one of those initiatives, the IMI-funded project IDEA-FAST (Identifying Digital Endpoints of Fatigue and Sleep Disturbance)

# Introduction to Actigraphy

.pull-left[
- Actigraphy is a **non-invasive** method of monitoring human rest/activity patterns through monitoring of **movement**.
- Often, a small wrist-watch with a built-in **accelerometer** is used to collect **actigraphy** data.
- Example derived data include: step count, time in intense physical activity, sleep time.

<img src="include/actiwatch2.png" height="200">
]

.pull-right[
<img src="include/cpiw_activity_count_traces.png">
]

???

- Actigraphy watches have accelerometers which measure movement in 3 axes (x, y, z)
- What's shown on the right is a summarized "activity count" which summarizes
  the amount of movement detected by the accelerometer in 1 minute **epochs**
  over a full 24-hour day.

# Why Create Personalized Activity Reports?

- We want to **provide value** to study participants with the data we are already collecting
  - Study participants expect it from consumer wearables.
- Typically the data collected in clinical trials is not shared with study participants (prevent unblinding, prevent biasing patient-reported data, QC'ed data not available in real-time)

???

- We wanted to provide value while also making sure we...
  - Prevent biasing data
  - Ensure data privacy
  - Increase patient engagement (drive better compliance)

# Activity Report in Phase 0 Study

.left-column[
- Ongoing Phase 0 Observational Study including a research-grade actigraphy watch
- Built a report and process for data sharing **during the study**
- Static PDF report with activity/sleep summary metrics
- Providing a report per participant per month
]

.right-column[
<img src="include/activity_report_tiles.png" height="450">
]

???

- Screenshot here shows the first page of the mock report which was delivered as a monthly summary.
- Initially had grand plans of making this like consumer-facing app but due to limitations with technology we were using we could not integrate directly into the study mobile app or use HTML / interactive plots. 
  - Had to use static PDF summaries available via the study mobile app or online dashboard as downloads

# Activity Report in Phase 0 Study

.left-column[
- Report is built using Rmarkdown and rendering to PDF
- All visualizations are created using R code
]

]

???

- Create the tiles with `geom_tile()` using the `color` column
- Add the numeric values as text in `value` column
- Add the labels for each box stored in the `info` column
- Use `geom_text()` to add the icons by specifying the unicode symbol.

# Activity Report in Phase 0 Study

.left-column[
- R code to create the daily bar chart of step count
]

.right-column[
<img src="include/activity_report_steps.png" height="450">

???

- Snapshot of average of the daily values for the entire month in calendar-like layout
- Given only after study participants complete the daily and weekly patient reported outcomes.

# Activity Report in Phase 0 Study

.left-column[
- Static PDF report with activity/sleep summary metrics
- Providing 1 report to each study participant per month
]

.right-column[
```{r step_plot, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

ggplot(data = plot_data) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#e7298a",

    ggtitle(format.Date(date, "%B %Y")) +
    getBaseTheme()

???

- The code for this plot is very simple in ggplot2 consisting of mainly `geom_bar()` and `geom_text` calls.

# Automated Creation of Activity Reports with Shiny

- Internal R Shiny app was built to facilitate creating these reports

<center>
<img src="include/shiny_dashboard.png" height = "400">
</center>

???

- Semi-Automated Workflow
  - Export Data from ActiGraph (actigraphy vendor's) dashboard
  - Upload data file into Shiny app
  - Select months and participants
  - Download a batch of activity reports
  - Transferred from Janssen to the virtual site to add to participant app/web portal.
- Workflow could be automated by pulling data from the vendor's API.

---

# Future Directions - Towards Interactivity

- Actigraphy data is rich in density and can be displayed in many different ways
- More research is needed to understand the best way to visualize the data and what data study participants want to see.
- Interactive graphics could be a way to engage participants who really want to dig into the data.

---

# Example - Doughnut Charts

```{r}

act_df <- data.frame(Asleep = 0.7,
                      Awake_Immobile = 0.05,
                      Awake_Active = 0.15,
                      Awake_HighlyActive = 0.10) %>%
    gather(key = "Type", value = "fraction")


```

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}

act_df %>%
  plot_ly(labels = ~Type, values = ~fraction) %>%
  add_pie(hole = 0.5) %>%
  layout(showlegend = TRUE,
         xaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE,
                      showticklabels = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE,
                      showticklabels = FALSE))

```

???

- Way to show percent of time spent in different (mobility) states
- Click around to show they are interactive and not static

<!-- NOTE: Update the dashboard to turn off the legend in doughnut plot -->

???

- Can host this on patient community portal
- Or can send as a standalone HTML file that allows patients to explore the data
- We are currently working to understand what our study participants would want to see

# Summary

- Inclusion of digital health tools, such as actigraphy, are increasingly used in clinical trials to better understand patient's activities of daily living.
- In addition to using the data for research, that data can be summarized in a way that is value for study participants. 
  - Showed an example of how we have **visualized actigraphy data** to create **personalized activity reports** in a phase 0 study.
  - When possible, actigraphy summary data can be shared back with study participants during (or after) the study.
